Next Todo
    * get input values (currently return nodes only) -- Complete
    * update get input to return input data vs logging data -- Complete
    * create validate input data function -- In Progress
        2 functions validiting input is valid - Complete as public method in DataController 
            1. validate network address - Complete

    * Update UI if input is invalid - Complete
        done, but bug. Need to reset for corrected valid input (remove invalid class)
        and this must be done for each input field
    
    * Setup Git - must do this Next

    * Create network object if input is valid



Notes from Budget App

App controller has an ctrlAddItem function which calls the UI.getInput function via the event listeners
Input is validated in the ctrlAddItem function and if valid, is used to call
BudgetCtrl.addItem function.

The BudgetCtrol.addItem creates  a new Item (either Income or Expense) object and returns a new Item to AppAddItem function in appController

So, for cidr

appController function appGetInput is used in by the eventlisteners to 
1. call UI.getInput and stores input data into an object
2. appGetInput validates each input attribute and if valid
3. calls dataController save setAttributes method and receives new network object.
